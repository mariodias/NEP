#' @title Get the effective number of parties.

#' @description This function returns the effective number of parties.
#' 
#' @param seats \code{array}. The total of available seats.
#' @param magnitude \code{int}. The district magnitude.
#' 
#' @details If you want to calculate the actual number of parties in a mayoral election, 
#' the ratio must be calculated between the total number of votes received and the total 
#' number of valid votes rather than the ratio between available seats and the number 
#' of seats obtained.
#' 
#' @return a number.
